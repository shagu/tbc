# TBC Repository

This is a repository where I collect/backup everything TBC. It's still a work in progress. Unless noted otherwise, assume everything is for the 2.4.3 patch. However, since there's little compatability issues between the patches of TBC, that shouldn't stop you from trying things out.

# Websites

Some sections of this repository have a website of their own. These are:

- [Addons](https://wvault.github.io/tbc/addons)
- [Macros](https://wvault.github.io/tbc/macros)

# Contributions

If you run into an issue or have ideas for improvement, please create an issue or a pull request respectively. Be warned, however, that I will be pretty stingy with merging pull requests (if I ever get one) because while this repository is here to help anyone, it's mostly here to help me and I'm very particular about things. You're always welcome to create forks.
