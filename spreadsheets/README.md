# Spreadsheets

Various TBC (2.0 to 2.4.3) spreadsheets accumulated over time. As numbers (damage/healing etc.) differ greatly from server to server and patch to patch, do not take what these spreadsheets are telling you as gospel, and do your own research. They are meant to be supplementary.

If you have a spreadsheet you'd like me to include in the vault, let me know.
